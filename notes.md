- JavaScript vs JSX
  - React lets you place HTML in the DOM
  - JavaScript lets you do that too
  - Show how to place stuff in DOM with document.createElement
    - const element = document.createElement('h1');
    - element.innerText = 'Hello javascript world';
    - element.classList.add('hero');
    - const container = document.querySelector('#app');
    - container.appendChild(element);
  - Show how to place stuff in DOM with React.createElement
    - import react and react-dom
    - replace document.createElement with React.createElement
    - pass in the class to React.createElement
    - pass in the text to React.createElement
    - replace container.appendChild(element) with ReactDOM.render(element, container);
  - Show how you can simplify with using JSX
    - jsx is just a way of writing deeply nested functions in a readable way
      - functions inside of functions inside of functions
    - ran through a compiler
    - import babel-standalone
    - change the type of script tag to "text/babel"!
    - rewrite the React.createElement call to use JSX
    - show in babel repl how props are placed into second argument: https://babeljs.io/en/repl
    - show in babel repl how you can nest tags inside of tags etc (.uio-red)
- Components
  - React's mantra is that the UI is a function of data
    - Pass some data in, get some UI out
  - Functions are the most basic building block in React
    - Call them components
  - A component is a function that returns some React elements (i.e. JSX)
  - Refactor the hero heading we've used so far to be its own component
  - By convention - components are PascalCased (starts with uppercase letter)
  - Show in babel repl how this component is passed into JSX as its first argument
- Props
  - React's mantra is that the UI is a function of data
    - This data is passed as an object, and we call that object props
  - Whenever the props change, React makes sure to call your function again and update the browser
  - Props can be anything - strings, numbers, arrays, functions, and even other objects
  - Rewrite Hero to accept prop "text"
  - Rewrite Hero to accept children prop instead
- Make into todo-list
  - Rename our hero to TODO
  - Create a list of items: {Â id, text, completed } inside of the App
    - Learn React
    - Remember to vote!
    - Figure out what DHIS stands for
  - Create new component todo with class todo
    - if completed prop is true, add todo--completed class as well
  - Say something about "escaping into JavaScript" and having to return a value
  - Map through the list with the .map function, and create <Todo />s
- Add new todos (state)
  - Let's add a field for adding new todos!
  - Create a form with an input (set placeholder) and a button
  - In order to save new todo, we need to keep track of the text
  - Remember when I said that React means that the UI is a function of props?
  - It's a function of props and state
  - State is just internal props - or data inside of the component
  - We can keep track of this data with a special function called useState.
  - This function is called a hook
  - Returns an array with two items - the state and a function to update the state
  - Call useState to create a new state variable for inputText
  - Pass the inputText to our input field - now it doesn't work
  - Add an event listener - triggered every time the value changes
  - Next, we want to add our todo to the list!
  - Create new function addTodo
  - Explain the preventDefault and why you need it
  - create a new todo constant - but what to do with it?
  - We need another state variable - one to keep track of our todos!
  - Refactor todos array to be a state variable
  - Add to end of list, start of list, and reset input
- Toggle todo
  - create new function toggleTodo(id)
  - map through old todos, use ternary
    - `todo => todo.id === id ? {...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo)`
  - pass this function into the Todo component
  - change the TODO implementation to use a button
  - send the onToggle prop into the onClick handler
  - voila
- Summary
